## ⚙️ Technologies Used

- HTML5  
- CSS3  
- AngularJS (v1.x)  
- JavaScript

## 🚀 Procedure

1. Create `index.html` and include the AngularJS library via CDN.
2. Define the AngularJS app and controller in `app.js`.
3. Initialize a counter variable in the controller.
4. Bind the counter data to the UI using `{{count}}`.
5. Implement increment and decrement functions using `ng-click`.
6. Style the page using `style.css` with centered layout and glowing button effects.
7. Open `index.html` in a browser and test functionality.

## 🎨 Design Overview

1. `index.html` defines the user interface and binds elements to AngularJS using directives like `ng-app`, `ng-controller`, and `ng-click`.
2. `app.js` contains the controller logic handling the counter operations such as increment, decrement, and reset.
3. `style.css` applies a dark neon theme with glowing button effects, soft animations, and a centered layout for an immersive club/casino-style appearance.

## ✅ Result

A visually appealing, interactive counter app was created using AngularJS with live data-binding, functional buttons, and a glowing dark UI.

## 📦 Installation (Optional)

No backend or build setup needed. Just open `index.html` in a web browser:

```bash
start index.html
```
